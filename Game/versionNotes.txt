 ** Last Update Note:
	Continued work on collision. Got it "working" as in now I can slide along walls with out clipping through them, unless you are sliding up and down the wall.
	Then clipping occurs, sliding left and right along the wall works fine until you get to the edge of said wall. Multiple object collision half works.
	I think I cheated the system on it to be honest.
